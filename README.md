# Nantou_iBus

This is a project that created in 2017 TSOC competition.

The main idea of this project is that Nantou didn't have a complete
application for checking and monitoring the bus status. For this purpose,
we collaborated with Nantou government and a QNap engineer to develope
an application called Nantou iBus.
